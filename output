Here's a paragraph summarizing your camera-to-text and file conversion project:

This project is a comprehensive web application that enables users to extract text from images captured via their device camera and convert files between various formats. The system features a user-friendly interface with dark/light mode toggle, beginning with a home page offering two main options: camera capture for text extraction or file conversion tools. The camera functionality allows users to take photos and process them to extract text, which can then be saved in multiple formats including PDF, Word, Excel, or plain text. The file conversion section provides robust tools for transforming documents between PDF, Word, Excel, and image formats, with options to split PDFs similar to popular online tools. The application guides users through each step with clear interfaces - from file upload to processing and final download - while maintaining a consistent, modern design across all pages. The implementation includes HTML structure, CSS styling with dark mode support, and JavaScript for camera access, text extraction simulation, and file handling, creating a complete end-to-end solution for document conversion needs.
